## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project

### 1. Prerequisites
- I'm using Node.js version 22.17.1; please ensure you're using the same version or a higher 

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Recommended LTS Version)
- [Ionic CLI](https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli) (install with `npm install -g @ionic/cli`)
- npm or yarn

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash

```
### 3. Running the Project Backend
Run the backend project (voting-api) first to avoid errors, as the API has not been deployed to the cloud yet.


### 4. Running the Project in Development Mode
Run the following command and open the application on browser

```bash
ionic serve
```
